# Devices
A user can add multiple hardware devices associated with her account.  These devices may be standalone units with their
own network connectivity (e.g. a satellite-based hardware PANIC button) or tethered to another device such as the
user's smartphone (e.g. a [BLE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth_low_energy) heart rate monitor.)

Alerts may be automatically triggered by a device depending on its level of sophistication.
