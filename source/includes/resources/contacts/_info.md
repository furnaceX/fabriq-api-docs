# Contacts
A user's contact receives alerts and notifications that are manually triggered or generated by FABRIQ.  When a
contact receives an alert and verifies it's a true emergency, he or she can escalate the alert by geo-blasting it
to the FABRIQ Network and/or being connected to the user's local 911 emergency call center.

A user can have multiple contacts and each contact can be added to one or more [circles](#circles).
