FABRIQ is a **Social Safety Platform**.  The API makes it easy to embed powerful and intelligent safety
features into apps and wearables.  Use it to trigger an alert, monitor an activity or periodically check on
the welfare of a loved one.  The possibilities to enhance personal safety are endless!

The API is organized around [REST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer) and uses
resource-oriented URLs. It makes use of HTTP verbs (e.g. GET, POST, etc.) to perform actions and
HTTP response codes (e.g. 200 OK) to communicate state.

All requests must be authenticated and sent over [HTTPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS). Responses are returned in JSON, including application and system errors.
