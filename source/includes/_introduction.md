The FABRIQ API makes it easy to embed powerful and intelligent safety features into apps and wearables.  Use it
to trigger an alert, monitor an activity or periodically check on the welfare of a loved one.  The possibilities
to enhance our personal safety are endless!

The API is organized around [REST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer) and uses
resource-oriented URLs. It makes use of HTTP verbs (e.g. GET, POST, etc.) to perform actions and
HTTP response codes (e.g. 200 OK) to communicate state.

All responses are returned in JSON, including application and system errors.
