# Circles
A circle enables a user to group a set of contacts. For example, a user may create a circle for their Friends and
another for their Family.  When a [PANIC](#alert-types) alert is triggered, the alert is automatically sent to all
the user's circles.  However, for certain alerts, such as [PING](#alert-types) and [TIMEOUT](#alert-types), the user
can choose which circles(s) receive the notifications.
