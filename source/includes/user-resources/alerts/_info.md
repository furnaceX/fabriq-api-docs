# Alerts
An alert can be triggered either manually by the user or automatically by the system.  A manual trigger requires
the user to activate a software or hardware button.  An automatic alert is triggered by the system when a certain
threshold is met.  For example, a `timeout` alert is triggered if an activity is not ended within a certain period
of time.
