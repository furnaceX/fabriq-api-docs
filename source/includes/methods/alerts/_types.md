## Alert Types
FABRIQ manages several types of alerts and notifications

### Panic Alert
An alert triggered by the user to indicate he or she is in immediate danger.

### Timeout Alert
This alert is triggered when the user does not end an activity within a specified period of time.

### Ping Alert
The user can request to have FABRIQ send him or her a periodic message (called a ping).  If the user does not
respond to this ping within a specified period of time, an automatic alert will be triggered.

### Watch Notification
The user can request to have his or her contacts notified that have started and/or ended an activity.  The user will
receive a message with a link to watch the user in real-time.
